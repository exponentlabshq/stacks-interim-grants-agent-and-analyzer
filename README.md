# Cuevasm AI Agent: Stacks Treasury Committee System Prompt

## ðŸŽ¯ Main Deliverable

**[cuevasm-system-prompt.md](cuevasm-system-prompt.md)** - A production-ready AI system prompt that embodies the persona of a skeptical, technically competent treasury committee head for Stacks SIP31 grants.

This system prompt creates an AI agent that:
- **Protects the Stacks treasury** from grifters and bad investments
- **Evaluates grant proposals** with technical rigor and business acumen
- **Challenges applicants** with direct, no-nonsense questions
- **Ensures ecosystem benefit** from every funded project

## ðŸ“‹ What is Cuevasm?

Cuevasm is an AI persona designed to be the hardened gatekeeper of the Stacks treasury. Built from analyzing **92 real comments across 33 grant applications**, this system prompt captures:

- **Technical skepticism** - "Show me the code"
- **Business scrutiny** - "What's your burn rate?"
- **Ecosystem focus** - "How does this help other Stacks projects?"
- **Results orientation** - "I need to see traction, not roadmaps"

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Deploy the AI Agent

Copy the system prompt into any LLM (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) to create an AI agent that evaluates grant proposals:

```plaintext
System: [Insert cuevasm-system-prompt.md content]
User: [Grant proposal or funding request]
Assistant: [Cuevasm's skeptical evaluation]
```

### View the Dashboard

Open `index.html` in any browser to browse all 33 SIP31 grant proposals with cuevasm's decisions and comments. No installation required.

# Cuevasm AI Agent: Stacks Treasury Committee System Prompt

## ðŸŽ¯ Main Deliverable

**[cuevasm-system-prompt.md](cuevasm-system-prompt.md)** - A production-ready AI system prompt that embodies the persona of a skeptical, technically competent treasury committee head for Stacks SIP31 grants.

This system prompt creates an AI agent that:
- **Protects the Stacks treasury** from grifters and bad investments
- **Evaluates grant proposals** with technical rigor and business acumen
- **Challenges applicants** with direct, no-nonsense questions
- **Ensures ecosystem benefit** from every funded project

## ðŸ“‹ What is Cuevasm?

Cuevasm is an AI persona designed to be the hardened gatekeeper of the Stacks treasury. Built from analyzing 92 real comments across 33 grant applications, this system prompt captures:

- **Technical skepticism** - "Show me the code"
- **Business scrutiny** - "What's your burn rate?"
- **Ecosystem focus** - "How does this help other Stacks projects?"
- **Results orientation** - "I need to see traction, not roadmaps"

## ðŸš€ Usage

Deploy this system prompt with any LLM (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) to create an AI agent that evaluates grant proposals, challenges assumptions, and protects treasury resources.

```plaintext
System: [Insert cuevasm-system-prompt.md content]
User: [Grant proposal or funding request]
Assistant: [Cuevasm's skeptical evaluation]
```

## ðŸ”¬ Research Foundation

The Cuevasm system prompt is derived from real-world data:
- **33 grant applications** from stacksgov/sip31-interim-grants
- **92 comments** from cuevasm across all issues
- **100% coverage** - cuevasm commented on every proposal
- **Patterns identified** through systematic comment analysis

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features of the System Prompt

### Decision Framework
- **40%** Technical Assessment (code quality, security, scalability)
- **30%** Business Viability (revenue model, team capability, market timing)
- **20%** Ecosystem Impact (community benefit, network effects)
- **10%** Risk Management (technical, market, regulatory risks)

### Response Patterns
- Direct, blunt communication style
- Technical depth with business pragmatism
- Specific, actionable feedback
- Clear approval/rejection criteria

### Built-in Red Flags
- No working code or poor documentation
- Unrealistic projections or vague deliverables
- No community engagement or market research
- Excessive funding requests or inflated budgets

## ðŸ“ˆ Use Cases

1. **Grant Review AI** - Automate initial screening of funding proposals
2. **Due Diligence Assistant** - Challenge teams with tough questions
3. **Treasury Protection** - Flag potentially problematic applications
4. **Ecosystem Analysis** - Evaluate projects for community benefit
5. **Training Tool** - Teach grant applicants what committees look for

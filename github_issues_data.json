      "body": "## üôÇ Grant Recipients\nThis portion of the interim grant options is focused on the top builders in the ecosystem as measured by TVL, providing funding to teams with greater than $5m in TVL. While TVL isn‚Äôt the only indicator of importance or success, the growth of these applications has a significant and disproportionate impact on the perceived health of the entire ecosystem. Each of these 5 teams has unique needs, so we‚Äôre in touch directly to discuss the capital or other resources they require in the short-term. \n\nTeams that don‚Äôt fit into this program are invited to [submit an open-ended grant application](https://github.com/stacksgov/sip31-interim-grants/issues/1) or participate in [DeGrants](https://degrants.xyz/cohort3).\n\n**Teams**\n- Zest\n- StackingDAO\n- Bitflow\n- Granite (No grant applied, needs being covered by Trust Machines)\n- Hermetica\n\n<img width=\"1245\" height=\"436\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5137d02-77df-4f6f-98c1-cc7a952793e6\" /> Snapshot as of 8.28.2025\n\n\nThis is the thread these builders will be expected to update the community on their progress as they work to grow their applications over the next several months and answer questions from the community as-needed.",

The grant shall bring back a swapping pool for LiSTX/STX so LiSTX holder can immediately unstack via swapping. \n- **Grant Impact:**‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää\n‚ÄäFirst, the grant will bring back immediate unstacking for liquid stacking users (LiSTX holders). Second, the grant will bring more innovation for liquid stacking protocols through competition. Third, Lisa is a liquid stacking protocol that can also be applied to more tokens than only STX and inspire more liquid stacking activity on Stacks, code and documentation is open source. Fourth, Lisa is governed through a transparent on-chain DAO and can inspire more projects to use on-chain governance. Finally, more integrations of LiSTX can be added in the future.\n- **Grant Risks:** \nAdding the swapping pair to a DEX is low risk, as there exist battle-tested flows. Adding liquidity to the LiSTX/STX pool has the risk of any other pool, however, the price is not volatile and any LiSTX can be converted to STX via normal unstacking (PoX). The biggest risk for this grant is that users move to Stacking DAO. We aim to mitigate that risk through public communication of the advantages of Lisa.\n- **Traction:** \n     - _Active users:_ all time holders: 17,602, current: 5480 holder of LiSTX\n     - _Transaction volume:_ 10k+\n     - _TVL:_ at height $18m+ / 7.5m STX, current $1.5m / 2.5m STX\n     - _Waitlist:_ No wait list\n\n## üõ£Ô∏è Grant Roadmap & Deliverables\n- **Deliverable:**‚Ää A swap pool LiSTX/STX on one DEX\n- **Milestones:** \n  1. Add swapping contract for LiSTX/STX pair to one DEX (bitflow, charisma, velar)\n  2. Update UI on lisalabs.io\n  3. Deploy liquidity from this grant\n  4. Promote swapping pool",

My understanding was that they were working to restore everything/everyone as it was before the incident. Given that it hasn't been done thus far by the teams closest to it and we're several months post incident at this point, I would like to better understand why you think it is a good time to prioritize it and what gives you the indication there is strong demand for it. Any info you have on why it hasn't been fixed post hack already or how many people are blocked by this and would regularly use the service would be really helpful. \n\nNext, maybe you can also speak to who would own this and make it a priority to drive users to if it was funded? Is that you and Marvin? Are you working with or plan to work with the ALEX and/or Lisa teams? Do you have clear indication from everyone that would need to be involved that this could and would be made a priority for them in the event funding is achieved? \n\nüôè",

          "body": "Sounds really cool Khoa, reducing complexity is always a worthwhile pursuit. \n\nIn terms of the traction indicators, you have referenced stx.city, but given this is a new/separate application, I'm curious to know more of your rationale/projection methodology for how many folks you expect to use the new application (which serves a different purpose in my mind). Perhaps you've done some polling or surveys with your existing users on this one and they've given you some indication they need this? Even some numbers on the folks you mention having tested the app would be really useful, even if it's just a handful--that you've built a demo and tested is a fantastic place to be.\n\nFor more context on my asks here, I think stx.city is excellent background for you as a builder, but not _necessarily_ indicative of customer validation for the Stacks Agent so I'd be looking for just a touch more data there (or for you to tell me why I'm wrong about that and stx.city is direct customer validation for the agent).

          "body": "Thanks Khoa! I hope I am not too annoying here, but I am really looking for hard data related to users of the demo or MVP of Stacks Agent. I think it's a good exercise to see what's going on in other ecosystems or with competitors, but it's only a guess that it will translate to demand on the Stacks side. Correct me if I've misunderstood, but I think this still uses _other_ projects as a proxy for possible demand, but I'd really like to see some clear indications of demand for the version you are building. Putting my Techstars/VC hat on for a second, there was always a ton of pushback on the 'if we just get 1% of X' approach to market sizing/customer validation, so I would suggest one of the following as likely easy for you to provide that would satisfy the traction box here:\n\n- Would you be able to share how many people tested the demos you built? Again, even a handful here is notable.\n- Or run a quick poll in your community for folks to indicate they would use this? This is the 'would you use it/how much would pay for it' type validation that is really helpful)\n\nWith something direct like one of those or similar, I think this is really strong. üôè ",

This grant will allow us to deploy and regulate our initial product, expanding primitives available to the ecosystem while demonstrating the strength of BTC-backed DeFi.\n\nGrant Impact:\nBy introducing gamified options trading, we will unlock new liquidity sources for the Stacks ecosystem, give users tools to hedge downside, speculate, and generate yield, and attract both retail users and institutions. Our roadmap includes BTC, STX, and eventually Runes as supported assets.\n\nGrant Risks & Mitigation:\nThe primary risks are insufficient funds to cover legal compliance and code audits. We are mitigating this by concurrently running a pre-seed strategic round to supplement the grant and ensure long-term sustainability.\nGrant Roadmap & Deliverables\n\nProposed Milestones & Structure\n\nWe agree with the committee‚Äôs feedback to prioritize MVP delivery and user onboarding before heavy legal spend. Accordingly, we propose the following milestone-based structure:\n\n   1.

          "body": "Hey Guy, thanks for this! We've taken time to deeply review this and the committee is generally quite interested. However, there's consensus about how we would suggest updating this before moving forward. I'll put them below and you can let us know if something along those lines are amenable. \n\nSuggested updates:\n- Generally, we want to flip the MVP to the first milestone after there's high-level/reasonable indication there's a viable legal path, which we can help with (see next bullet). This is because want to see something working and users onboarding before we see too much going into ops like legal; we're of the opinion (and we can confirm this with real lawyers), you're unlikely to be at risk for a beta test or closed user base and that we have some runway there to prove this idea out on Stacks further before heavily investing in it.\n- To help with this, we have some volunteers to help you out on the legal side so you can further save some capital there with resources we have in the ecosystem.\n- We'd like to break up the milestones/rewards a bit differently, still giving you some working capital, but optimizing for getting deeper into customer validation on Stacks before going heavy into legal. \n\nIf you are open to this at a high-level, one of our committee members can help you rework it and then we can review it again. Let us know!",

In the process of building marketplace, we estimate that there will be 1-2 teams start to inscribe theirs tiny collection on stacksinscription again(there ever were 4 teams trying to launch their collection), and individuals keep inscribing and inscription number grows from present 3577 to at least 4200.(inscription marketplace is ouf focus, stx10 orderbook place indeed has been finished , we only need to restart ,but in this period most stx10 volume will happen in Alex).\n\n2: For milestone 2, invite some well-known NFT collection on Stacks migrate or launch their new collections on stacksinscription and achieve 3000+ independent active inscription users ( the largest collection on Stacks has 3131 holders)to unlock additional $10k funds.\n\nThe estimated parameters:  there will be at least 2 former well-known NFT teams launching or migrating their collections on stacksinscription, the inscription numbers will grow to at least 12000, and independent owners addresses will grow from 333 to at least 3300. Also the inscription NFT inscribing activities will promote stx10 tokens minting activities, there will at least 20k new mints on stx10.\n\n3: getting mainstream marketplace and wallet integration like Gamma,Xverse, Leather.( within 3 months)\n\n4: stx10 achieves first 1M mints out of \"satoshi\" tick and burns 50K STX.(within 4 months).\n\n5: stx10 achieves 5M mints at least and burns 250k STX or more.(with 6 months).\n",

As the committee reviews, I would love to see some more current data about MAUs for Stackscriptions and some more indications about the demand for a marketplace specifically. I think this would be more useful now than the lifetime holders data so we look forward to that! Further, given that a 6 month timeline is listed here, I'd like to break this down into smaller milestones, the idea is that we move toward getting more information about the demand/traction as we move along - could you take a stab at restructuring this such that we get to an MVP much more quickly?",

Please include a few clear parameters by which the community should consider that milestone successful as to then open up more funding. For example, \"launch MVP in October, achieve X many users, unlock additional $10k, etc\". To your own point, it's unclear whether or not this is important to users at this moment so the goal here is to scope down to something that allows to prove there is demand before investing more heavily. If you can define a path along which we're getting a clear signal about demand and traction then this becomes more straightforward to fund. Thanks!",

          "body": "Thanks Sam, happy to see this one come through. A few questions to start:\n- Have you looked into bringing down the startup costs for the hubs? These strike me as the perfect things to have donated by local coworking spaces and/or municipalities. In my days building up Startup Weekend, we were often able to get very heavily discounted or free equipment and space for educational purposes. It seems like with the partners and government contacts you have, this is an area you could really bring down costs and give these parties a clear way to bring value to the program, thereby getting them even more invested in your success.\n- Next, relative to the costs of other programming we do, $10,000 against 3x workshops times 100-200 attendees is a bit high - it would be stronger if we could ensure that these attendees aren't simply attendees, but actual converts to an ongoing program or deep embed into the Stacks ecosystem, perhaps Code4STX or something like that. I've mentioned this to Adam and Kenny so they could work with you on some solutions there. For the cost, we'll need to see _very_ high retention.\n- Could you also speak to a bit more about how the Bitcoin nodes directly benefit the participants or the Stacks network? (Beyond the obvious that its just better to have more nodes in the world?) üôè.\n- How much of the efforts here will be Stacks-focused vs. more general or other ecosystems? Is it something like 80/20? 50/50? If I understand the vision correctly this is bigger than just Stacks, which is great, I just think we all want to understand the high-level focus mix. \n\nThinking ahead a bit, there's a chance I'd recommend you work directly with the Stacks Labs team on this vs. a Stacks Foundation grant. As we move through this transition, their team is taking up driving events/marketing/devrel/etc. while we tighten our focus on governance matters. Through them you can better align with the rest of the global marekting and devrel efforts that are all tied into their product team who is working on clear guiding metrics. Especially considering a major percentage of the activity proposed here is workshop and event based, it may just make a lot more sense to plug you in with them -- I'll reach out to them and come back to you on it!\n\nThanks!",

          "body": "Hey again @cliqueengagements - the committee is working toward approving this. Here's where things stand:\n\n1. We want to see more clearly what your expectations/projections are around how many people will join Stacks at each of these milestones. This is an important disctinction between 'attendees' - we want to know the expected retention numbers to the ecosystem either through joining other programs like Code4STX, Ascent, or by staying around and building something in the ecosystem such that we'd consider them 'onboarded' or 'retained' for the eco. These projections will be important so we can see if this is benefitting Stacks along the way as much as we expect it to - as these folks join and numbers are strong, continued funding is straightforward.\n2. Upon funding the first milestone (pending the input we need from you on item 1), we'll require that you connect directly with the Stacks Labs team to ensure that your efforts are integrated into the global event and content strategy on some level. This will ensure you have support of major Stacks social channels and some of the other resources that will likely be useful to you in many aspects of this endeavor. I will take the action item to connect you and set the context.\n3. Next, we propose that instead of funding an initial Milestone of $10k, we deploy $20k such that you have more wiggle room upfront. As such, the M1 expectations/projections I'm asking for in item 1 maybe need to be bumped up just a touch. Our thinking is that a bigger initial payment, based on the strength of your previous efforts, helps build stability and legitimacy for more partnerships and onboarding of other parties before you have to worry about M2 too quickly. As a condition of this, we will discuss reporting to the sponsorship team at Stacks Labs to ensure we're maximizing every opportunity to pull in other dollars to fund your events and workshops alongside the Foundation's. I would look at this more as a resource/service to you more than raw oversight - the team there is happy to put the network to use to help you pull in sponsorships as we see this as very 'sponsorable' (not a word?) ü§£\n\nPlease let us know if this is amenable and please take a swing at updating the milestones from attendees to retained devs (or similar) and we can move this forward. \n\nThanks!",

          "body": "- Thanks @cliqueengagements in terms of **'Success Metrics'** I'm actually asking if you can provide projections based on what you think is possible with your programming. I don't feel equipped to project these for you, we just need to understand how many folks you see actually joining the ecosystem beyond simply attending an event. We're flexible to your proposals for how this can look, what we should consider conversion, what is quality engagement, etc. I assume that you've designed for these things already and have internal projections you can surface. As a reference point, we consider between 30% and 50% retention a success for our ongoing devrel programs, but this is high as we've been able to tweak and improve these over a long period. \n- **Integration:** Let's nail the success metrics down first and then we can hop on various calls and work with the Labs team directly to unpack the details on integration after we can get you approved and moving - this isn't complicated or constricting, we just want to be coordinated on some level with the global devrel efforts for mutual benefit. This is probably not all that different from how you've worked with Adam in the past, but I'm not prepared to speak in detail to Stacks Labs inner workings at this time. There's no desire to block you or slow you down, just to make sure the team running devrel knows what's coming, knows how to help, and can support you and has a direct line to you.\n- Reporting is the same for all grants, we expect updates every 2 weeks posted here to the issue - we understand not every update will be major but we want the community to be able to track progress and see signs of progress all along the way.",

Core randomness and move integrity are verifiable (commit-reveal + Bitcoin block hash entropy), and all key flows are on Stacks.\n- **Grant Impact:**‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚ÄäStrike converts our proven Find2Earn audience into on-chain Stacks users, driving wallet activations, recurring transactions, and market activity around Gear NFTs. We will also ship reusable Clarity patterns (commit-reveal randomness, durability/repair NFTs, on-chain raid coordination) and showcase practical sBTC use (ticketing, repairs, and boss payouts).\n- **Grant Risks:**\n- Economic imbalance (faucets > sinks) ‚Üí live-ops ‚Äúdials‚Äù (repair price, raid rate, boss pool, drop mix) with telemetry; target cover-ratio 1.3‚Äì1.6.\n- Fairness/cheating ‚Üí commit-reveal for PvP choices, BTC-seeded randomness for loot; on-chain event anchors and public verification guide.\n- Bots/Sybil ‚Üí Soul-gated access (NFT), novice caps, behavior heuristics, signed short-TTL links; referral rewards paid only on first purchase & first successful PvE run.\n\n- **Traction:**\n- Active users: 150+ unique winners; 1,000+ Find2Earn rounds; Storyline F2P: ~1.8k+ encrypted NFT mints; Competitive hunt: 2,500+ mints with $10000+ payouts.\n- Transaction volume: Thousands of on-chain NFT mints/burns/merges\n- TVL: Not applicable (game layer; treasury flows tracked, not custodial TVL).\n- Waitlist: we run live onboarding via daily games and stream partners.\n\n## üõ£Ô∏è Grant Roadmap & Deliverables\n- **Deliverable:**‚Ää\n- Clarity contracts: Soul Slots (access NFT), GearNFT (rarity, durability, merge/repair), Economy (fees/treasury), RaidManager (loot distribution & randomness), PvPCommit (move commit-reveal).\n- Backend: combat/raid simulator, fairness proofs, logs, signed URL service (for future Encrypted NFT hooks), anti-bot gating.\n- Frontend: mobile-first ‚Äúmanga-in-motion‚Äù duel UI + basic raid flow; wallet connect; inventory & repair/reroll/merge panels; dashboards (cover-ratio, activity).\n- Docs & open-source: tests, verification guide, and a public Fairness page.\n\n- **Milestones:** \n\nWe fully agree with the lean, data-driven approach. We have reordered our milestones to prioritize a true MVP, validating the core \"fun factor\" before building out the full economy.\n\n**Milestone 1: The \"True MVP\" - A Playable 1v1 Duel Demo (Weeks 1‚Äì4, $9,960)**\n\nGoal: Get the core combat loop into players' hands ASAP to validate one thing: Is the game fun?\n\nDeliverables: A web-based, mobile-first 1v1 duel interface. A simplified backend combat simulator. Basic Clarity contracts for a set of pre-minted \"demo\" Gear NFTs (no durability or drops yet).\n\n‚úÖ Success Criteria for Unlocking Further Funding:\n\nAchieve 1,000+ duels played by 200+ unique wallets within 30 days of launch.\n\nOnboard 100+ net new users (wallets created/connected to try the demo).\n\nAchieve a community feedback score of >80% \"would play again.\"\n\n**Milestone 2: Building the Economy - PvE & Sinks - (Weeks 5‚Äì8, $12,120)**\n\nGoal: Once the MVP is proven fun, we build the sustainable economic engine around it.\n\nDeliverables: Implement the core economic contracts: Gear durability & repair sinks (using sBTC/Skull). Simple PvE battles against mobs. On-chain loot drops (VRF-based). Basic NFT merging.\n\n‚úÖ Success Criteria for Unlocking Further Funding:\n\nProcess 500+ on-chain repair transactions.\n\nDemonstrate a positive Sinks/Faucets ratio on a micro-scale.\n\nAchieve 2,000+ PvE battles completed.\n\n**Milestone 3: Scaling to Co-op & Full Integration - (Weeks 9‚Äì12, $7,920)**\n\nGoal: With a fun core loop and a working economy, we scale to the full social and cross-game experience.\n\nDeliverables: Full 4-player co-op raid functionality. Boss mechanics with damage-based payouts. Full integration of sBTC for ticketing and prize pools. Crucially, linking the Find2Earn game to Strike, where discovering world locations unlocks raid access.\n\n‚úÖ Success Criteria:\n\nSuccessfully run 100+ full co-op raids.\n\nProcess a meaningful volume of transactions using sBTC.\n\nDemonstrate the full, sustainable economic flywheel in a live environment.\n\n## üßÆ Sustainable Economy\n\n- Core loop: PvE raids (4 players). Each raid drops exactly one Gear NFT (25% per player). 1/3 of raids escalate to a Boss ‚Üí payouts split by damage.\n- Sinks: Durability Repair (primary), Reroll, Merge/Burn (5‚Üí1 rarity trade-up), and ticketing for 50% of daily raid seats. Merge only at full durability ‚Üí forces repair before burn.\n- Faucets: Boss payouts + events.\n- Balance condition: ‚àësinks‚â•‚àëfaucets over a 7‚Äì30d window; live-ops dials (repair price, raid rate, boss pool, drop mix).\n- sBTC use cases: ticketing, repairs, tournament escrow, and optional boss payouts (configurable per season) to showcase Bitcoin-denominated spend & rewards on Stacks.\n\n**Detailed economy & formulas, budget breakdown, and UI screenshots:** [Notion link](https://notch-lens-325.notion.site/Skullcoin-Grants-2025-2757d5fab641803686cdf351115d14b5?source=copy_link)",

Please provide this figure and then separately a projection for the *new* users you would expect this grant to generate and the rationale for the projection (aka show us your math üôè )\n- How do you see the funding working against milestones? How can we get something into the market with fewer expenses so we can drive back some more data that its working and there's a clear demand to double down on? There seems to be a lot of upfront building of recyclable aspects and contracts (which is fine), but I think we risk building a ton of stuff without first proving we can market this thing and onboard a ton of folks first. Could you take a stab at flipping the milestones such that get to market as quickly as possible against the smallest budget possible (ala a true MVP) and then for subsequent milestones list the success criteria where you think it would be fair to open up further funding. \n\nAnd separately/generally, I'd like to better understand the bet for Bitcoiners here. Do we feel that games built on Stacks are particularly well-suited to provide a best in class experience or to enable a new audience that wouldn't otherwise participate to do so? If so, why? Here I'm just looking for your higher-level thesis as I'm not an expert in gaming - I have not seen a particularly fervent community of gamers overlapping with Bitcoiners, but would love to see some data about how it's there and just outside my particular bubble.\n\nThanks!",

If someone can log in with Google, play a game, or watch an ad and instantly have a working wallet that just ‚Äúfeels like an app,‚Äù then we‚Äôve succeeded. From there, we want to guide users step by step into stacking and holding tokens, without forcing them through seed phrases, exchanges, or confusing flows.\n- **Grant Impact:** It intends to bring in new users who wouldn‚Äôt normally interact with the Stacks blockchain at all. In practical terms, that means thousands of wallets created through simple onboarding, users generating transactions every day just by playing and claiming rewards, and at least some of them moving into stacking. The SDK would let other developers reuse the same login + wallet system.\n\n- **Grant Risks:** The app not having the expected impact. This should be handled by promoting the app before being launched. We intend to attract Web2 users mainly through the app's gamification process.\n- **Traction:**  -\n\n## üõ£Ô∏è Grant Roadmap & Deliverables\n- **Deliverables:**‚Ää \n  - Integration of google login in Leather mobile wallet\n    - Secure wallet backup and cross-device recovery.\n  - SDK that lets other developers use Google-based onboarding and wallet features in their apps\n  - Mobile app with Google login and automatic Stacks wallet creation.\n    - Reward system with minigames, ads, referrals.\n    - Ad-sponsored transaction flow to keep UX Web2-like.\n    - In-app stacking and token purchase.\n    - Integration of stacking, sBTC yield and DeFi protocols.\n  \n\n## Milestones\n### Milestone 1: Seamless Onboarding & Wallet Integration in Leather Mobile App\n\n**Duration:** 135 hours - 3.5 weeks\n\n**Budget:**¬†$12,150\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n- Users can authenticate with Google, automatically receive a secure non-custodial Stacks wallet, and restore their wallet across devices without handling private keys.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n- **Authentication & Wallet Setup** - 45h\n    - Implement mobile app shell (iOS + Android).\n    - Integrate Google OAuth2 login flow.\n    - Encrypt mnemonic with the user‚Äôs chosen password/biometric and store it in Google Drive (`appDataFolder`).\n- **Wallet Recovery** - 30h\n    - Implement cross-device wallet restoration.\n    - Test reinstall/recovery flows for resilience.\n- **Scalability & Security** - 60h\n    - Validate encryption scheme for wallet backup.\n    - Conduct penetration testing of login/restore pipeline.\n\n**Expected traction:**\n\n- ~200 users minimum first couple of weeks.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\n- Establish the foundation, validate core functionality, and confirm early interest.\n---\n### Milestone 2: Multi-App SDK & Ecosystem Integration\n\n**Duration:** 175 hours - 4.5 weeks\n\n**Budget:**¬†$15,750\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n- Expand adoption with an SDK that lets other developers use Google-based onboarding and wallet features in their apps.\n- Enable one Google account **‚Üí** one wallet across multiple apps.\n- Integrate the SDK into:\n    - Leather extension\n    - Xverse app and extension\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n- **SDK Development** - 50h\n    - Provide APIs for core functionality:\n        - `loginWithGoogle()`\n        - `getAddress()`\n        - `getBalance()`\n        - `sendTransaction()`\n        - `contractCall()`\n        - `stack()`\n- **Cross-App Continuity** - 40h\n    - Standardize wallet retrieval/decryption from Google Drive.\n    - Ensure one Google account = one wallet across applications.\n- **Developer Resources** - 40h\n    - Publish documentation, code samples, and integration guides.\n    - Provide reference implementations.\n- **Scalability & Security** - 45h\n    - Test wallet retrieval across multiple apps and devices.\n    - Validate SDK signing logic and prevent unauthorized key access.\n\n**Expected traction:**\n\n- Allow DeFi protocol access through Gmail, 1000 wallets minimum using these features.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\n- Open the door for all Leather/Xverse users to connect with Google across apps (e.g. Zest pools, Bitflow swaps), ensuring the feature is actively used in real scenarios.\n\n--- \n### Milestone 3: Incentivized Engagement & Reward Loops\n\n**Duration:** 240 hours - 6 weeks\n\n**Budget:**¬†$21,600\n\n**Outcome:**\n\n- Users engage daily through minigames, ads, referrals, and streaks, earning real STX rewards.

          "body": "Thanks team, looks very interesting! I am wondering if you could please rework the milestones to align with the budget unlock. Ala, let's establish what success looks like at Milestone 1 such that the community can understand 'this is working' in terms of real growth/traction, etc. such that its obvious we should unlock further funding. Our strong preference is to see early MVPs and proof of concepts with real testers/in the wild feedback and traction before approving larger amounts. This allows us to derisk the grant and ensure that what is being built is getting adopted along the way (vs. ending up in January with something that isn't as important as we guessed). \n\nFor example, if feasible, I'd highly recommend you work with one of the major wallet teams or apps straight away so that you can test the Google login feature with an established user base. Both Xverse and Leather already have established mobile apps, so this would significantly cut down upfront costs to build something from scratch, allowing us to prove and perfect this with both real users and real builders before building out all the rest or having to bootstrap testers on your own.\n\nI'd be happy to setup some calls with folks you may explore this with because I don't see creating an entirely separate app to start as the leanest way to prove this out. Essentially, I'd like to see you flip this and build and perfect the SDK first, onboard an app or two, then branch out into a separate mobile app. I feel pretty strongly that this would maximize early impact and make further funding an easy decision.",

I also see this as a big bet on retail and activity there is way down across the board now so I'd ask this: What elements of this grant might also benefit apps that serve institutions, if any?\n\nAnd we still need to see your reconfigured milestones please.",

          "body": "Thanks again @BowTiedSirJonathan - the reworked milestones look generally good to the committee with one caveat. We still want to see user numbers or other forms of traction indicated at each Milestone. We will use this to determine if 'this is working', so please decide on what you think is fair to onboard at each section. For example, in the first milestone you will ship the ability to restore without a seed phrase, so please list how many users we can expect to have done this or tested this before we move on to milestone 2. Put another way, we don't want to get to M2 and no one has used or touched this thing.\n\nSame with M2-M4, please indicate the growth/traction we should be looking for and that we can agree is success such that we can keep releasing funding at every step. These don't need to be massive, massive numbers, but something realistic that proves people want and need this and we're making the effort to get to users all along the way. The right partnership with a wallet or other app could get you those numbers virtually over night, so I'm happy to work with you on proposing a test partnership with one of the major wallets.\n\nWith these updated, we should be ready to approve.

This grant ensures continuity of proven operations while expanding distribution across multiple channels to grow ecosystem visibility.\n\n### Grant Impact\n\nBy December 2025, the Stacks community will continue to benefit from daily live coverage, weekly SIP & Innovation livestreams, and consistent short-form distribution across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and X. These efforts will expand reach and engagement across multiple channels, driving measurable growth in impressions, audience participation, and ecosystem visibility. Early website upgrades (Calendar v1 and basic content tools) remain part of the broader roadmap, improving discoverability of events and content as complementary funding allows. A points-system concept doc will establish the foundation for incentivizing participation and sponsor-aligned behaviors.\n\nBeyond this grant cycle, DeOrganized is building toward sustainability through sponsorships and content/distribution contracts. We‚Äôve already secured partners such as StackingDAO and Bitflow, and our long-term plan is to expand these partnerships and add new revenue models. This positions DeOrganized to reduce reliance on grants while continuing to provide independent, trusted media coverage for the Stacks ecosystem.\n\n### Grant Risks\n\n* **Overextension:** Scope creep could dilute delivery. *Mitigation ‚Üí narrowed MVP scope focused on achievable, high-impact growth.*\n* **Platform Reliance:** Viewer engagement depends on X and YouTube distribution. *Mitigation ‚Üí diversify into TikTok and Instagram.*\n* **Financial Sustainability:** Operations depend on co-funding. *Mitigation ‚Üí ongoing sponsorships (StackingDAO, Bitflow) and partnerships (Zero Authority DAO, BoostX, BNS.one, Skullcoin, fak.fun, BigMarket.ai).*\n\n### Traction\n\n* **Active users:** 800‚Äì1,200 daily live show viewers; 3,000+ weekly unique participants\n* **Transaction volume:** N/A (media-first project)\n* **TVL:** N/A (media-first project)\n* **Waitlist:** None ‚Äî audience access is live and open\n* **Additional Indicators:** ~250,000 monthly impressions (3-month average) and over 126,000 live viewers (past 6 months); partnerships with StackingDAO, Bitflow, Zero Authority DAO, BoostX, BNS.one, Skullcoin, fak.fun, BigMarket.ai; approved press access for Bitcoin 2025; sustained audience growth since launch\n\n---\n\n## üí∞ Budget Narrative\n\n**Total Project Budget (Oct‚ÄìDec 2025): ~$32,000**\n\n* Founder Continuity Stipend: $15,000\n* Team Support Pool: $6,000\n* Apps & Services: $3,000\n* Audience Growth & Promotion: $2,000\n* Phase 1 Website v2 (calendar + early content tools): $4,000‚Äì$6,000\n\n**Grant Ask:** $20,000 (to cover core operations, team stipends, and tools)\n\n**Co-Funding Sources:** ~$12,000 expected from sponsorships, partnerships, and DeGrants to support Phase 1 website development and promotional activities.\n\n---\n\n## üõ£Ô∏è Grant Roadmap & Milestones\n\n**Funding Structure:**\n\n* $5,000 upfront to support ongoing operations and baseline deliverables.\n* $5,000 released upon successful completion of milestones at each checkpoint.\n\n### Deliverables & Outcomes (Ongoing)\n\n* ~72 daily shows, ~60 news threads, weekly SIP & Innovation livestream coverage, and event coverage.\n* On-chain participation: Publish a points-system concept doc outlining an audience rewards framework to incentivize participation and sponsor/partner-aligned behaviors.\n* Early website upgrades: Calendar v1 + basic content tools.\n* 10+ short-form clips per month on YouTube Shorts/TikTok.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è **Each milestone represents both continuity of programming and measurable growth in audience reach and engagement, while also tracking directional traffic to Stacks ecosystem destinations (wallets, Ascent, SIP/forum, events).**\n\n---\n\n### Milestone 1 ‚Äî October 2025 ($5,000 upon completion)\n\n* Deliverables: Daily shows/news threads; weekly SIP livestream coverage; short-form clips.\n* Outcomes: Establish baseline growth tracking across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, X, and Discord. **Implement outbound click tracking (UTMs/Bitly) to measure traffic driven to key ecosystem pages (wallet installs, Stacks Ascent, SIP/forum discussions, events) and set a CTR baseline.**\n* Growth Targets:\n\n  * TikTok: 1,600 views ‚Ä¢ 200 reached ‚Ä¢ 20 engagements ‚Ä¢ 75 followers\n  * Instagram: 2,800 views ‚Ä¢ 2,800 accounts reached ‚Ä¢ 75 followers\n  * YouTube: 5,000 views ‚Ä¢ 70 watch hours ‚Ä¢ +10 subs\n  * X: 290K impressions ‚Ä¢ 18K engagements ‚Ä¢ +75 followers\n  * Discord: 110 members ‚Ä¢ 10 active participants\n\n---\n\n### Milestone 2 ‚Äî November 2025 ($5,000 upon completion)\n\n* Deliverables: Daily shows/news threads; weekly SIP livestream coverage; expanded short-form distribution.\n* Outcomes: Continue audience growth across channels. **Report first directional traffic results (CTR and total clicks) and target 10‚Äì15% growth over M1 baseline.**\n* Growth Targets:\n\n  * TikTok: 2,000 views ‚Ä¢ 300 reached ‚Ä¢ 30 engagements ‚Ä¢ 120 followers\n  * Instagram: 3,500 views ‚Ä¢ 3,500 accounts reached ‚Ä¢ 120 followers\n  * YouTube: 6,000 views ‚Ä¢ 85 watch hours ‚Ä¢ +15 subs\n  * X: 330K impressions ‚Ä¢ 20K engagements ‚Ä¢ +125 followers\n  * Discord: 140 members ‚Ä¢ 20 active participants\n\n---\n\n### Milestone 3 ‚Äî December 2025 ($5,000 upon completion)\n\n* Deliverables: Daily shows/news threads; weekly SIP livestream coverage; year-in-review programming; publish points-system concept doc.\n* Outcomes: Sustain audience growth across all channels. **Provide cumulative directional traffic report and target 10‚Äì15% growth in CTR and total clicks over M1 baseline.**\n* Growth Targets:\n\n  * TikTok: 2,500 views ‚Ä¢ 400 reached ‚Ä¢ 40 engagements ‚Ä¢ 175 followers\n  * Instagram: 4,300 views ‚Ä¢ 4,300 accounts reached ‚Ä¢ 175 followers\n  * YouTube: 7,500 views ‚Ä¢ 100 watch hours ‚Ä¢ +20 subs\n  * X: 375K impressions ‚Ä¢ 22K engagements ‚Ä¢ +200 followers\n  * Discord: 175 members ‚Ä¢ 30 active participants\n",

          "body": "Thanks for the application @PerrinoProperties! It generally makes sense to me and feels like a continuation of things ongoing. My two questions are these:\n\n- What is the long-term plan to make these efforts self-sustaining beyond grant funding? Is that hinted at here via the mention of sponsorship? (ala like we did from the Stacks Foundation recently?)\n- To approve, I'd like to see growth projections instead of content deliverables. In other words instead of measuring the act of doing '72 shows, 60 threads, etc.', can we place some goals here for each milestone that measure the growth and/or engagement we expect to see? This would help us understand better how these things are trending and their impact vs simply that we got them done. We do the same thing with each of our efforts, we don't measure how many developer events we do, we measure how many developers we onboarded to programs and I'd like to see these milestones/deliverables reframed similarly. \n\nThank you!",

Is there a possibility of picking a fair number here for conversions to things like wallet sign ups, in-person events, or other programs like Stacks Ascent/Code4STX, or [insert whatever you think is fair here, app signups, etc.]\n\nThese don't need to be huge as I think the primary consideration of the show is broad awareness and community communication, but it would be nice to see some nominal on-chain growth from all this too. What do you think? Does this create perverse incentives or stretch the intent too much? Fwiw, I think some commitments along this lines gets this done üôè",

Unlike speculative DeFi, which rely on market guesses and whims, we‚Äôre tying actual revenue from profitable businesses to on-chain liquidity, and this grant will help us launch V2 with confidence in a compliant way.\n- **Grant Impact:** _Stated in 2-3 sentences, what do you hope this grant does for the ecosystem? Think in terms of measurables and try to describe what has happened as a result of your grant being successful._\n  - This grant will launch our first tokenized offering, roll out a platform for business tokenization, and deliver the first dividend to liquidity providers within six months. It‚Äôll put PropertyX on the map as a go-to for stable, business-backed real yields, something Stacks DeFi and DeFi in general desperately needs. PropertyX will inspire more RWA innovation in the ecosystem. Our successful V2 launch with dividends flowing back to LP providers will set the stage for VC funding to keep us growing strong.\n- **Grant Risks:** _What are the primary things that can go wrong or reasons why the grant would not be successful? How do you plan to mitigate them?_\n  - We‚Äôre stepping into new territory with RWAs, so regulatory hiccups could slow us down; we‚Äôre tackling that head-on with $20K from the grant for expert legal and tokenomics guidance. If a developer drops off, Builders Academy‚Äôs talent pipeline has us covered.

          "body": "Thanks @binayatripathi - RWAs are certainly an area of intrigue so I'm happy to see this. A few questions as we review:\n\n- Have you had conversations about a proper fundraise? Candidly, my fear is that an effort like this is much more capital intensive than any grant I could provide would allow for. \n- Next, where is the $20,000 in legal fees coming from, is that a quote you received? It's generally difficult for us to directly fund things that cover others legal fees so we should consider how to restructure the application some.\n- Have you budgeted for an audit (or some version of a deep, deep check on contracts holding user funds)?\n- What will the liquidity requirements of the protocol be? Is the grant intended to cover incentives for LPs? Sort of back to my first point, something like this would likely be pretty capital intensive to bootstrap so I'm trying to plan ahead such that we don't fund a build that we can't ultimately support growth for. \n- Last, I'd like to see the milestones be reworked around impact or traction. i.e. your first Milestone has this by referencing the 1 business client on mainnet - the other milestones should be done similarly so we have a shared view of whether or not this is working and can unlock further funding.",

          "body": "Hey @binayatripathi - we're still looking forward to hearing a bit more related to my questions above. However, we met today and discussed your grant in detail. Here's what we'd be ready to approve:\n\n- The initial milestone of $26,000 (20,000 legal) under two conditions (1) that this legal expense is turned into a published document/framework and 'open-sourced' for the community. There are other RWA efforts in the ecosystem and so for this grant, we want to be sure it benefits as many builders as possible. (2) that you source multiple bids for this work before deciding on a provider.\n- From there, our opinion is that the grant doesn't request enough relative to the actual cost of bootstrapping this business model and to fully fund something like this is beyond the means of this program. To that end we want the initial milestone approval to give you some time to keeping working in the short-term, getting you past the first legal hurdle while we support you in a proper fundraise through our network. This is something I'll personally drive with an initial set of introductions in the ecosystem and something our grant committee member, Jonathan Sadlowe, can help directly with as well (he's a VC). Our rational is this: In addition to some of the things you've listed, you will need to be able to pay for things like audits, whitehats, custody providers, listings (and the many costs associated with those including a KOL plan, lawyers, etc., a whole lot for bootstrapping some initial liquidity, and many more expenses both predictable and unpredictable. We believe you're ready to take this step and it would be necessary to position PropertyX for success - if success happens fast, you'll want to have the funding on hand to lean into growth and so a round here would be great.\n\nFor now, please confirm whether you accept the terms from item 1 and then please setup some time with me to discuss the fundraising suggestion: https://calendly.com/mitchellcuevas ",

          "body": "Thanks Binaya, I think the change is reasonable. I'd look at the $20k as essentially an ecosystem expense with you being the first real beneficiary and the $15k being what is really the first milestone here for PropertyX. And perhaps to state the obvious, if the legal expenses come in under that amount we'll simply pay whatever they are. If they come in over, we can discuss a plan and likely pick up the delta from other sources. \n\nThe milestones for growth are clear for M1/M2, but please merge all the commentary and final milestones into the original issue itself and clean it up so the final structure and agreement are very clear. To clarify as well, I am *not* (as you put it) committing to driving your fundraise - what I offered and the furthest I can go is making an initial wave of introductions, you will have to drive the fundraise. We have some resources and mentors to help you there, but need to be clear you're the pilot and solely responsible :). \n\nWith that, I'm happy to approve the first two milestones as it were - you'll get a follow-up from my team next week with next steps. Congrats!",

          "body": "Thanks @dantrevino - a couple questions/asks for you! \n\n- We need to see dollar amounts associated to milestones. In addition, on the given milestones we need to see what success looks like at each such that the next milestone should be unlocked. Generally we want to see signs of traction at each milestone (i.e. x many new users, etc.) vs. binary 'we shipped X' because that tends to anchor us in impact (like user growth, feedback, TVL, etc.). I think given the base you already have this should be easy to project, thanks! \n- Generally, I'd like to better understand why it is important to include chat and features like that - it seems to me like what you have here is a core product based around peer-to-peer payments which in and of itself is a pretty major undertaking. Is there a route where you can cut costs by focusing on nailing that experience first and then expanding into the other features? Or are things like the 'Community Layer' absolutely critical in the early days for this to be successful? To my outside eye, it looks like there are items that could be labeled as 'nice to haves' relative the core use case, but I'm happy to have you explain that I'm wrong about it. \n\nIf you can respond a bit for the committee and adjust the milestones a bit as noted in my first bullet, that'll help us continue reviewing.

The general belief is that we can have testers and some folks kicking the tires on this well before M3 so that we can prove there is some interest and you're getting direct user feedback early and often. This can be a small cohort. With your stature in the community the waitlists you've mentioned, we believe this would be relatively straightforward for you - the idea here is to encourage shipping something usable as quickly as possible and then layer in additional features. \n\nThis may not work for you, but one example we discussed was focusing first on the wallet to wallet messaging feature. What's the simplest way you could allow people to play with that today inside a web app or something? If you can rack up some message activity and people playing with it, it's easy to see demand and approve the rest which will rely on this feature (for the marketplace). A point of emphasis for our grants now and going forward is avoiding a 'build it and they will come' scenario where they don't come later and we're surprised by it. I'm happy to jump on a call with you and help you rework the milestones in real-time along this path. Ping me and we'll get it set asap!",

Do you have a partnership established? \n- In terms of the milestones, they are disconnected from funding - can you please update them such that each Milestone has a dollar value (subset of the overall 30k request) at each one? We also need to know clearly what success looks like at each milestone and generally, a release is not enough on its own, we want to see some user or other traction number that clearly indicates this is working such that subsequent milestones can be released. If you can create the acceptance criteria/metrics for the milestones that would help immensely, as those are hit it's easy to release milestone funding. \n\nThanks!",

Demonstrated track record of leading mentees and helping them secure permanent full-time jobs in tech (Ayden, Christina, Tien, etc.)\n\n## üìÉ Grant Overview\n- **Grant Name:** Design-Driven Development (DDD) for Stacks\n- **Total Budget (USD, STX, or BTC):** $16,000 USD (8 projects √ó $2,000/project, delivered biweekly over 16 weeks)\n- **Grant Goal (in one sentence):** Train and mentor a cohort of 5-8 UI/UX designers through hands-on design audits and redesigns of 8 top Stacks applications (one project every 2 weeks), building a sustainable talent pipeline while improving ecosystem UX and reaching 2,000+ community members through public education.\n- **Grant Audience:** Aspiring UI/UX designers, front-end developers seeking design skills, Stacks project teams, Bitcoin builders, and the broader Stacks community\n- **Grant Team:** Rocky (@rockyntheblock)\n\n## üìä Impact Metrics & Cost Justification\n\n**Primary Impact: Designer Training**\n- **5-8 trained UI/UX designers** with professional portfolio work (8 real projects each)\n- **Cost per designer trained:** $2,000-$3,200 per designer for 16 weeks of intensive mentorship\n- **Value created per designer:** Each trained designer can deliver $50k-$100k+ annual value to ecosystem (based on industry design rates of $75-150/hour)\n- **ROI timeframe:** Each designer generates 15-30x return within first year through project work\n\n**Secondary Impact: Ecosystem Reach**\n- **8 Stacks project teams** receive professional design audits and implementation guides\n- **2,000+ community members** reached through 8 biweekly livestreamed review sessions\n- **500+ engaged viewers** attending live sessions and participating in Q&A\n- **100+ developers** implementing design improvements based on audits\n- **50+ builders** accessing reusable component library and design patterns\n\n**Tertiary Impact: Long-term Ecosystem Growth**\n- **Stacks Design Guild formation** creating sustainable talent pool for future projects\n- **70%+ designer retention** ensuring trained designers remain active in ecosystem 6+ months\n- **Self-sustaining mentorship** where trained designers mentor next cohort\n\n**Cost Breakdown & Justification:**\n- **Mentor compensation (Rocky):** $8,000 (50% of budget) - 20+ hours/week for 16 weeks (one intensive project every 2 weeks) including audit work, mentorship sessions, livestreams, and deliverable reviews\n- **Mentee stipends:** $4,000 (25% of budget) - Small stipends for 5-8 mentees ($500-800 each) to enable participation\n- **Tools & infrastructure:** $2,000 (12.5% of budget) - Figma licenses, design tools, hosting for component library\n- **Community bounties:** $2,000 (12.5% of budget) - Implementation bounties for projects adopting designs\n\n**Why designers are valuable:**\n- Industry shows $100 return for every $1 invested in design\n- Rocky's proven track record: Zero Authority and BNS One success demonstrate measurable business impact\n- Design talent shortage is critical bottleneck for Stacks builders preparing for TGEs and listings\n- Trained designers provide ongoing value across multiple projects (not single-use)\n\n## üöÄ Grant Mission, Impact, Risks, and Traction\n\n- **Grant Mission:** Empower 5-8 aspiring UI/UX designers in the Stacks ecosystem to learn professional design practices through hands-on mentorship, real-world project audits, and collaborative creation of experience design prototypes. By training designers on 8 high-impact applications driving the path to $1B TVL in DeFi, we establish a sustainable talent pipeline that elevates design as a first-class discipline alongside smart contract development. As the leading Bitcoin L2 focuses on DeFi growth, user experience is table stakes‚Äîthis grant ensures the ecosystem has the human capital needed for long-term sustainability and builder success.\n\n- **Grant Impact:** The critical output is a cohort of 5-8 trained UI/UX designers equipped with real-world experience on 8 major Stacks applications (BoostX, Deorganized Media, Velar, StackingDAO, Hermetica, Boom Wallet, Faktory.fun, and Skullcoin). Each designer will work alongside Rocky in a mentorship model, learning to conduct audits, create prototypes, and deliver professional redesigns. Beyond the core cohort, the grant reaches 2,000+ community members through livestreamed sessions and provides professional design resources to 8 project teams. As Stacks accelerates toward its $1B TVL milestone and positions itself as the fastest Bitcoin L2 with superior user experience and low-cost transactions, design excellence becomes critical infrastructure. This acts as a design-powered social layer that strengthens the leading Bitcoin L2 by attracting and retaining design-driven community members, ensuring builders have the resources needed as adoption scales.\n\n- **Grant Risks:** \n  - **Risk:** Designer mentees may lack foundational skills. **Mitigation:** Screen candidates for basic design understanding (portfolio review + skills assessment), provide beginner-friendly guides, and offer 1-on-1 mentorship sessions tailored to skill level. One interested participant is currently in school studying UI/UX Design.\n  - **Risk:** Low retention of trained designers post-grant (target: 70%+). **Mitigation:** Build community through biweekly livestreams, create ongoing paid opportunities through project partnerships, establish Stacks Design Guild with recurring projects, and track retention via 3-month and 6-month check-ins.\n  - **Risk:** Quality dilution with multiple designers producing work. **Mitigation:** Rocky reviews all deliverables before publication, provides multiple feedback loops per project, establishes quality rubric for audits/prototypes, and maintains high bar demonstrated in Zero Authority and BNS One work.\n  - **Risk:** Low community engagement in livestreams. **Mitigation:** Partner with project teams to promote sessions, offer bounties for participation, record and publish for async viewing, and leverage existing Stacks community channels for distribution.\n\n- **Traction:**\n  - **Zero Authority:** Rocky's UI/UX redesign delivered exceptional measurable results:\n    - **10x increase in unique visitors** (+~970%)\n    - **25x increase in page views** (+~2,370%)\n    - **32% bounce rate improvement** (44% ‚Üí 30%)\n    - **4,700+ event completions** (from low baseline to massive engagement)\n    - Increases in transaction volume, new wallet creation, and revenue generation\n  - **BNS One:** Design improvements led to strong user adoption and platform success, demonstrating ROI on design investment\n  - **Existing demand:** 3+ designers already interested in participating based on informal outreach\n  - **Project interest:** Multiple projects (BoostX, Deorganized Media, Velar) already confirmed interest in receiving design audits\n  - **Ecosystem demand:** As Stacks focuses on DeFi growth and targets $250mm TVL by end of Q2 2025, the ecosystem lacks comprehensive UI/UX training despite strong backend infrastructure with Nakamoto, sBTC, and Clarity 4 upgrades\n  - **Builder needs:** Stacks builders with listable tokens and growing protocols need professional design support to compete as the ecosystem scales and attracts millions of users\n  - **Proven ROI:** Industry standard shows $100 return for every $1 invested in design‚Äîcritical for value accrual as adoption accelerates\n  - **Alignment with roadmap:** This grant complements ongoing ecosystem growth initiatives including SIP-031 Interim Grant program, Stacks Ascent, and DeFi growth plans\n\n## üõ£Ô∏è Grant Roadmap & Deliverables\n\n**Duration:** 16 weeks (4 months)\n\n**Schedule:** One project every 2 weeks to allow for thorough mentorship and high-quality deliverables\n\n**Primary Deliverable:** Cohort of 5-8 trained UI/UX experience designers equipped to elevate Stacks ecosystem design standards.\n\n**Biweekly Deliverables (8 complete packages):**\n\nEach 2-week cycle focuses on one application with designer mentees working alongside Rocky:\n\n1. **Design Audit Report** - Mentees learn to identify UX issues, friction points, accessibility gaps, and user flow problems through hands-on analysis\n2. **Experience Design Prototypes** - Mentees collaboratively create multiple design variations and prototypes under Rocky's guidance\n3. **UI/UX Redesign** - High-fidelity mockups with complete design system (colors, typography, components, spacing) produced by mentee team\n4. **Live Review Session** - Public walkthrough streamed to the Stacks community where mentees present their work and receive feedback\n5. **Implementation Guide** - Component specifications, front-end recommendations, and technical documentation\n6. **Mentorship Sessions** - 1-on-1 classes and design critiques helping mentees develop professional skills\n\n## üìà Milestones: Impact-Focused\n\n**Milestone 1 -

          "body": "Whew just squeezed that one in under the deadline ay @exponentlabshq ü§£. \n\nThe committee met this morning and this grant was one of the more in-depth conversations. There is a lot to like here and the spirit of improving design/experience for Stacks apps is a good one. That said, funding an agency model generally hasn't been a focus for grants in the past - there are various reasons for this that I won't bore you with here, but we put our heads together on 'what could we say yes to' in this general realm. \n\nHere's what we're proposing: \n- Approve the first Milestones, but at $8k, double the requested amount for M1 and 50% of the total request. You would still serve two teams as proposed at 2k and 2k, but with the rest of the funding, we'd like to see that work get abstracted into a design kit, docs, guidance, a course, or some combination you think is the best fit that is widely usable by the rest of the builders. We think this will be more impactful because it is a resource that can scale vs. being essentially the agency trap where there's always limited bandwidth of the providers talent hours. Worth noting: it is is tricky for us to get into the game of subsidizing some folks' design work through an effort like this and not others, it is a losing game of perceived fairness for us where one team feels slighted they weren't given the same resource, so this sidesteps that issue using the first two teams as guinea pigs from which you can create a resource that helps everyone.\n- Beyond that, we'd like to see your measurables align to outcomes and impact for the business instead of 'views'. Some of the strong support from @xyzerobtc is a good example, though we have not dug into the attribution methodology (we're happy to take y'alls word there and just assume that it was only design work that resulted in all that growth, but this is typically really hard to accurately measure). Could you take a swing at a reworking them accordingly with impact based outcomes instead of listed views?\n- Further, the guild and training aspect is very interesting, but we're not fully convinced that we can take folks from 'aspiring' to high-quality designers in such a short time as to be impactful on a schedule that helps key teams break out fast. Our preference would be that you focus on bringing in/recruiting _already_ trained and skilled designers for pointed, clear projects in the ecosystem (perhaps in the order you've already laid out). If you can matchmake and align on clear scopes with clear impacts, we can fund those as subsequent milestones. Our rationale: Training brand new designers is difficult and takes longer than 6 months except with very rare exception so we think this would reduce risk and ensure the quality of this talent. Our opinion is that we don't need to train folks from scratch, there are many designers hoping to get into the space that already have skills and are well developed - bootcamps for taking folks from zero to professional already exist. \n\nFor now we're provisionally approving M1 as I've outlined it above pending your confirmation. We will wait to hear from you on the second two items so that we reconsider the rest of the proposal. Thanks!",

      "title": "Jing Cash Endowment STX Provision - Zero Fee Trading for Stacking Pools",
      "body": "**Jing Cash Endowment Proposal: Zero-Fee STX Trading Infrastructure**\n\n---\n\n**Topic:** Jing Cash Endowment STX Provision - Zero Fee Trading for Stacking Pools\n\n**Category:** Apps ‚Ä¢ Stacks DeFi\n\n**Tags:** `stacking` `defi` `trading` `yield` `endowment` `proposal` `no-kyc`\n\n---\n\n**Overview**\n\nJing Cash is currently offline but represents proven technology. The codebase has been battle-tested through previous live deployments and has undergone comprehensive security audits. The platform is deployment-ready and will operate as an L2 Stacks order book, similar to the STX/BTC market on https://www.beefyswap.fun/markets/STX_BTC except only on L2.\n\nThe system requires no guarantee deposits - users simply lock STX or sBTC and unlock by sending the counterpart token. Most importantly, **no KYC is required**, addressing a critical pain point in the ecosystem.\n\n**The KYC Problem**\n\nCurrent trading solutions create significant friction for stacking pools. A recent example: 3hunna encountered unexpected KYC requirements when swapping via Changelly (https://x.com/3hunnatheArtist/status/1964039842326802451), causing transaction delays. This scenario is unfortunately common - multiple stacking pools have reported reward distributions being frozen pending ID verification and documentation requirements.\n\n**Proposal: Endowment-Backed Zero-Fee Trading**\n\nWe propose the endowment provide STX liquidity to Jing Cash in exchange for zero or near-zero fees. This creates substantial benefits:\n\n**For Stacking Pools:**\n\n* Eliminates the typical 1-2% fees charged by platforms like SimpleSwap\n* Removes exchange slippage costs\n* Provides superior pricing compared to existing alternatives\n* Increases net yields distributed to stacking participants\n* Maintains complete privacy with no KYC barriers\n* **Enables seamless stacking reward distribution automation**\n\nPool operators can now automate the entire flow: BTC rewards ‚Üí bridge to sBTC ‚Üí P2P orderbook conversion to STX. This eliminates manual intervention and creates a smooth, automated reward distribution system.\n\n**For the Endowment:**\n\n* Automated STX liquidity distribution system\n* Portfolio diversification into Bitcoin\n* Reduced manual treasury management overhead\n* Win-win economic model with measurable ecosystem impact\n\n**Economic Benefits:**\n\nStacking pools currently lose 1-2% on every swap due to platform fees plus slippage. By eliminating these costs, pools can increase their effective yield distribution by the same margin. The endowment's STX provision enables this fee structure while ensuring adequate order book liquidity.\n\nPool operators can build fully automated conversion systems, removing operational friction and manual processes from reward distribution.\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n\n* L2 Stacks native operation for optimal user experience\n* Trustless lock/unlock mechanism without deposits\n* Proven order book architecture with audit history\n* Permissionless access - no registration or verification required\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis proposal positions the endowment as critical DeFi infrastructure while delivering measurable value to stacking pools and their users. The combination of zero fees, no KYC, automated processes, and battle-tested technology addresses the ecosystem's most pressing trading challenges.\n\n**Important Note:** The code for this system is ultra simple and has been extensively battle-tested through Jing Cash deployments and previously via Friedger's Catamaran swaps. The technical risk is minimal given this proven foundation.\n\n*Community feedback on implementation details and fee structures welcome.*\n\nTL;DR: \nJing Cash is a P2P platform that lets stacking pools swap their Bitcoin rewards for STX tokens without KYC requirements or the typical 1-2% fees charged by platforms like Changelly, SimpleSwap or Binance. The proposal asks the Stacks endowment to provide STX liquidity to enable zero-fee trading, which would save stacking pools money on every conversion while giving the endowment Bitcoin exposure. This would increase the actual rewards distributed to stackers since pools wouldn't lose 1-2% to trading fees and delays from KYC verification. The system would need ongoing liquidity replenishment since stacking pools receive hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin rewards every two weeks that must be converted to STX, but price oracles like Pyth or DIA could automate the rebalancing process to make it a set-and-forget solution, though that requires additional work but can be done if mandated. Essentially it's a win-win where the endowment funds a more efficient exchange system that benefits the entire stacking ecosystem.",

      "body": "## üôÇ Applicant Information                \n- **Email:** raficostar@gmail.com\n- **Twitter:** @RaphaStacks\n- **Main project/association:** Jing Cash - Transparent P2P Trading Infrastructure\n- **Notable ecosystem achievements or impact:** \n  - Deployed and operated battle-tested order book trading system with comprehensive security audits\n  - Built trustless atomic swap mechanism requiring no guarantee deposits\n  - Created proven L2 Stacks trading infrastructure similar to [[BeefySwap](https://www.beefyswap.fun/markets/STX_BTC)](https://www.beefyswap.fun/markets/STX_BTC) but with full transparency and on-chain settlement\n\n## üìÉ Grant Overview\n- **Grant Name:** Stacking Rewards Optimizer - Transparent On-Chain Infrastructure\n- **Total Budget (USD, STX, or BTC):** $20k USD total - $10k for transparent on-chain reward optimization infrastructure + $10k for automated Foundation positioning system (audit costs not included)\n- **Grant Goal (in one sentence):** Deploy transparent on-chain infrastructure to eliminate the hidden 2% fees bleeding from stacking rewards while making all reward conversions fully transparent and auditable.\n- **Grant Audience:** Stacking pool operators losing rewards to hidden fees, stackers wanting transparent reward distributions\n- **Grant Team:** @Rapha-btc\n\n## üöÄ Grant Mission, Impact, Risks, and Traction\n- **Grant Mission:** Address immediate stacking pool crisis where 2% rewards disappear into opaque off-chain platforms like Changelly/SimpleSwap with hidden fees and non-transparent mechanisms. Deploy battle-tested transparent atomic P2P infrastructure (similar to [[BeefySwap](https://www.beefyswap.fun/markets/STX_BTC)](https://www.beefyswap.fun/markets/STX_BTC) but fully on-chain and transparent) NOW to stop reward hemorrhaging. Time is money - every cycle delayed costs pools thousands in hidden fees and opacity. All transactions become transparent, auditable, and fee-optimized. Foundation gains positioning as transparent stacking rewards optimizer through automated liquidity provision against whitelisted pools.\n\n- **Grant Impact:** Immediate transparent relief: stops 2% hidden fee bleeding happening every cycle, all conversions become fully auditable on-chain, directly increasing stacker payouts starting next distribution. Eliminates opaque off-chain mechanisms causing reward distribution uncertainty. Foundation gains strategic positioning as ecosystem's transparent stacking optimization infrastructure. STX suppliers get transparent automated Bitcoin exposure through verified pool trading. Measurable transparent ROI: every $100k in pool rewards saves $2k+ in hidden fees with full on-chain auditability.\n\n- **Grant Risks:** Timing risk - every delayed cycle means continued hidden fee bleeding and opacity for pools. Liquidity management requires ongoing attention until automation deployed. Technical risk minimal given proven codebase. Main risk is NOT deploying fast enough to capture immediate transparency and savings opportunity.\n\n- **Traction:** \n     - *Active users:* Multiple stacking pools experiencing immediate hidden fee bleeding and opacity concerns\n     - *Transaction volume:* Hundreds of thousands USD in pool rewards processed bi-weekly through opaque platforms, losing 2%+ to hidden fees each cycle\n     - *TVL:* N/A (P2P system optimizes transparent flow, doesn't hold funds)\n     - *Waitlist:* Urgent demand from pools seeking transparent alternatives to opaque platforms with hidden fee structures\n\n## üõ£Ô∏è Grant Roadmap & Deliverables\n- **Deliverable:** Live transparent stacking rewards optimizer enabling immediate on-chain auditable sBTC/STX trading with zero hidden fees (similar to [[BeefySwap](https://www.beefyswap.fun/markets/STX_BTC)](https://www.beefyswap.fun/markets/STX_BTC) but fully transparent L2-native relief), featuring Foundation positioning as transparent automated stacking ecosystem optimizer through whitelisted pool integration.\n\n- **Milestones:** \n  - **Milestone 1 ($10k):** Build the basic P2P trading infrastructure - essentially a transparent order book where stacking pools can swap their sBTC for STX without going through centralized exchanges like Changelly/SimpleSwap. This eliminates the 2% fees and makes transactions transparent/auditable on-chain.\n  - **Milestone 2 ($10k):** Add automation where the Foundation provides STX liquidity and can \"set-and-forget\" - meaning they automatically trade their STX for sBTC at market rates specifically with whitelisted stacking pools. This creates a win-win where pools get instant liquidity without fees, and the Foundation gets automated Bitcoin exposure.",

Tenero serves both end users and builders by offering accessible data and infrastructure.\n- Grant Team:‚Ää‚Ää @MilanoCuts @reubs_btc\n\n## üöÄ Grant Mission, Impact, Risks, and Traction\n- Grant Mission:‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää Our mission is to bring world-class analytics and transparency to the Stacks ecosystem through Tenero (formerly STXTools). With a focus on real-time data, Bitcoin-native integrations like Runes, and developer-focused infrastructure, we aim to make Stacks the most accessible L2 for traders, collectors, and builders alike.\n- Grant Impact:‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää Along with providing ongoing support for much needed community infrastructure this grant will accelerate the rollout of advanced metrics and live data feeds for all major DEXes and NFT platforms on Stacks. Having both Stacks tokens  and L1 Runes we aim to highlight and onboard new users to the ecosystem. We expect to 3x our user base, double API usage, and onboard more builders through comprehensive API documentation and open integrations. A successful grant will make it easier for users to explore, trade, and analyze tokens and NFTs on Stacks. This lowers the barrier to participation, encourages more trading activity and liquidity provision, and helps developers build on top of reliable, real-time data.\n- Grant Risks:   \n  - Data node/API instability: mitigated by robust fallback mechanisms and historical sync architecture  \n  - Overextension of scope: mitigated by focusing on clear milestones and community needs first  \n  - Limited external adoption: mitigated by strong existing demand and planned outreach to protocols and dApps\n- Traction:  \n  - Active users: Between 300 and 2,000 daily active users over the past 18 months, with usage spikes around key trading events and ecosystem launches. This reflects consistent demand for on-chain analytics and tracking tools within the Stacks ecosystem.\n\n## üõ£Ô∏è Grant Roadmap & Deliverables\n- Deliverable:‚Ää A fully upgraded, real-time version of STXTools (under the Tenero brand) including Bitcoin L1 Runes support, wallet dashboards, expanded pool/token pages, and developer-facing API documentation. The platform will be publicly accessible and continuously updated.\n- Milestones: We will aim to roll out regular platform upgrades along with key new features;\n - Add L1 Runes token analytics to the v1 launch\n - Integrate a web trading interface directly into the platform making it seamless for users to trade\n - Add a social content creation hub to empower creators and expand network reach",

          "body": "Thanks for your application! As we review, I'd love to understand more about the longer term plan for sustainability.\n\nStxtools has been in the wild for some time and has previously stated the following: \"We haven‚Äôt ever taken funding from anyone and it still is self funded to this day. We provide a key service and the product has been revenue generating for a while now and with our new release it will boost revenue a lot\" - https://x.com/reubs_btc/status/1952031526717124854\n\nThis was last month, so I am curious about a couple key things:\n- Has the team's thinking about taking funding changed? \n- Did the new release mentioned in this tweet have the expected impact of increasing revenue? Why or why not?\n- What happens with the tools after the grant money is used up? What are the plans for funding the efforts/costs of ongoing maintenance?\n\nSeparately, I want to better understand what drives your expectations in this statement: \"We expect to 3x our user base, double API usage\". I don't know that I'm ready to accept that its as simple as additional documentation or integrations (that's a bit build it and they will come) so I would like to better understand the rationale for these projections. Things like direct indications from the existing user base about this demand, customer validation surveys, waitlists, etc. are helpful on this.\n\nLast but not least, has there been clear evidence that building inroads to Runes has onboarded Stacks users/benefitted the network? I assume so, but would like to see that data added to your proposal as its a key assumption/mechanism that this grant is based around. \n\nThanks!",

How can we be sure that we don't end up funding a Runes analytics platform that serves the Runes community but there isn't any gain for Stackers in the process? \n\nWe'd also like to see a deeper breakdown of milestones, preferably front loading further customer validation of the biggest assumptions in the grant proposal - could you please take a swing at that?

The best I can tell, it is an educated guess and inferences based on some activity on Bitflow, which is not a problem to be clear. However, I am still probing to see what the very specific value props is for each of the audiences the platform plans to serve. Maybe you can more specifically articulate the user stories that your platform will serve and in what order? I think the proposal is suffering from there being a lot of stuff you're doing with the platform plus that there is some that already exists and so forth so its harder to parse than 'fresh' grant if that makes sense. As a result, I have personally lost sight of the underlying fundamentals and I think others may also be struggling to follow along if they aren't incredibly familiar with the existing platform and its intricacies. \n\nI want to be sure that what we approve is focused with a clear impact expected and has a clear way to judge its success quantitively. I think you can leave out the way you're planning to market this for now and focus on the product fundamentals as it's more important we all understand very clearly what is getting built that is 100% new, what is getting updated (and why), and what outcomes you expect to be driven by each of the new features 1 by 1. \n\nTo be explicit in what I think helps the committee: Can you please list user stories for each of the primary audiences you intend to serve and put them in priority order along with the acquisition numbers you project? Ex. As a Runes trader I will be able to X or Y [expect to onboard ### of Runes traders. And on for the others you have mentioned in the application, i.e as a Stacks holder I can,... as a developer I can...and on :)\n\nLet's reset there with product fundamentals/use cases that this grant opens up and we'll be much closer, thank you so much!",

This bridge enables existing SIP-10 tokens (including established meme tokens) to access ICP's fast trading rails, while allowing ICRC tokens from ICP to bridge to Stacks and gain Bitcoin finality, agentic powers, and access to mature DeFi infrastructure - all without requiring fundamental protocol changes or special mint/burn privileges.\n\n- **Grant Impact:** This grant captures and retains waves of degen capital seeking speed by bridging to ICP's fast rails, while simultaneously attracting ICP's ICRC token holders to Stacks for Bitcoin security, AI agent integration, and established DeFi protocols. With Odin.fun achieving $1B volume demonstrating speed demand, and ICP's growing token ecosystem seeking security-first infrastructure for autonomous agents managing large capital, this bidirectional bridge keeps liquidity flowing within the Bitcoin ecosystem family while expanding access to ICP's computational advantages.\n\n- **Grant Risks:** Primary risks include complexity of cross-chain message passing and potential security vulnerabilities in bridge design. We mitigate this through leveraging ICP's proven chain fusion technology, starting with a limited pilot program, and extensive testing with established tokens before expanding to new assets.\n\n- **Traction:** \n     - *Active users:* fak.fun launches like B Blocks achieved $100k volume and top Alex trading position\n     - *Transaction volume:* Proven track record with successful meme token launches and AI DAO collaborations\n     - *TVL:* Alex runes bridge limitations create clear market gap\n     - *Waitlist:* Multiple community tokens from our launchpads unable to bridge via existing solutions\n\n## üõ£Ô∏è Grant Roadmap & Deliverables\n- **Deliverable:** A production-ready bridge consisting of Clarity smart contracts on Stacks, ICP canisters, and a user-friendly web interface for seamless token transfers and trading.\n\n- **Milestones:** \n  \n  **Milestone 1 ($35,000) - Technical Foundation & Proof of Concept**\n  - Learn Motoko and implement ICP chain fusion architecture\n  - Build basic Clarity smart contract for Stacks side of bridge\n  - Create proof-of-concept demonstrating successful token transfer between chains\n  - Establish security framework and testing protocols\n  \n  **Milestone 2 ($40,000) - Production Bridge & Interface**\n  - Deploy production-ready bridge contracts on both networks\n  - Build intuitive web interface for users to bridge and trade tokens\n  - Integrate with existing Stacks wallets and ICP ecosystem\n  - Launch with pilot tokens and establish liquidity pools\n  - Document APIs and create developer resources for future integrations",

      "body": "## Applicant Information\n\n**Email:** rossragsdale@gmail.com\n**Twitter:** @lordrozar\n**Main Project/Association:** Welshcorgicoin (WELSH) - First Bitcoin L2 memecoin to achieve product-market fit\n\n**Notable Ecosystem Achievements:**\n- **WELSH Community Leadership** - Steward of Stacks' largest memecoin community with 20,000+ unique wallets of holders, organic growth without venture funding, and proven ability to drive ecosystem-wide user adoption\n- **Stacks Foundation Developer Relations** - Official DevRel role since June 2025, created countless hours of technical education content, comprehensive developer resources, and production infrastructure\n- **Charisma DeFi Platform** - Architected and deployed full-stack DeFi platform managing $2M+ peak TVL, demonstrating production-grade smart contract and liquidity management expertise\n\n---\n\n## Grant Overview\n\n**Grant Name:** WELSH 5-Year Stakeholder Acquisition Engine\n\n**Total Budget:** $1,000,000 USD in STX\n\n**Grant Goal:** Systematize WELSH as Stacks' user acquisition engine through 5-year daily DCA that creates stakeholders (not just users) following the proven BONK playbook, generating measurable ecosystem growth through aligned financial incentives and emotional community attachment.\n\n**Grant Audience:** Prospective Stacks users attracted through speculation opportunity, existing 20,000+ WELSH unique wallets who became organic evangelists, Stacks DeFi ecosystem benefiting from sustained trading activity, and broader Bitcoin L2 participants seeking proven community-driven growth models.\n\n**Grant Team:**\n- Ross Ragsdale (GitHub: @r0zar) - Lead Author & Community Steward\n- GPSC [gigapepe92@gmail.com] - Community Coordination\n- Justin Enjo (GitHub: @enjoywithouthey) - Strategic Advisor\n\n---\n\n## Grant Mission, Impact, Risks, and Traction\n\n### Grant Mission\n\nWELSH already drove Stacks' largest user adoption curve in Q4 2023, demonstrating organic capability to attract and retain ecosystem participants. This grant systematizes that proven success by following the institutional playbook established by Solana Foundation's backing of BONK: deploy consistent, transparent liquidity support to flagship memecoin, creating speculation-driven user acquisition that converts into lasting stakeholder engagement.\n\nDaily DCA deployment ($550 STX/day over 5 years) creates predictable trading opportunity that attracts new users to Stacks infrastructure. Unlike traditional marketing spend that creates passive users, every WELSH holder becomes organic evangelist‚Äîtheir investment value depends on Stacks ecosystem success, creating self-sustaining promotion engine. STX issued from Treasury flows directly into ecosystem-wide aggregated liquidity pools and burns atomically to permanent address, eliminating custody risk and ensuring liquidity benefits all Stacks DEXes equally.\n\n### Grant Impact\n\n**Solana Foundation backed BONK explicitly as user acquisition tool. Result: millions of new Solana users, sustained ecosystem growth, and flagship community asset. This grant replicates that institutional playbook for Stacks.**\n\n**Stakeholders, Not Just Users:**\n\nEvery WELSH holder becomes organic evangelist. Their bag's value depends on Stacks success‚Äîfinancially incentivized to onboard friends, create promotional content, and build applications. The \"dog coin\" pattern (DOGE, SHIB, BONK) creates emotional attachment traditional tokens cannot replicate: cultural phenomenon, not just financial instrument. Beyond financial incentives, WELSH creates tribal identity and emotional attachment. Holders promote Stacks from genuine enthusiasm, not just profit motive. This combination of aligned financial incentives and emotional community attachment produces exceptional stickiness‚ÄîWELSH holders exhibit unusual loyalty to both token and Stacks ecosystem.\n\n**Quantifiable 5-Year Outcomes:**\n\n- **User Acquisition:** 2,000-5,000 new Stacks wallets created through speculation participation (conservative: 1-2 new users daily over 5 years)\n- **Transaction Volume:** 20-50x increase in WELSH daily trading volume = sustained DEX fee generation benefiting validators and liquidity providers\n- **Ecosystem Discovery:** Speculators arriving for WELSH discover sBTC, NFTs, DeFi applications‚Äîorganic user funnel to entire Stacks infrastructure\n- **Permanent Liquidity:** $1M in trustless, burned liquidity becomes ecosystem-wide asset supporting future growth\n- **Organic Promotion:** 20,000+ stakeholders generating social media content, developer interest, and cross-chain attention without marketing budget\n\n**Financial Responsibility:**\n\nUnlike Foundation grants funding development with uncertain user outcomes, this delivers measurable cost-per-acquired-user. Traditional crypto marketing: $1,000+ CAC with high churn. This grant: estimated 2,000-5,000 new stakeholders at $200-500 CAC who financially depend on Stacks success (5-year retention built-in). More fiscally disciplined than traditional grants lacking CAC tracking or user conversion metrics.\n\n**Zero STX Price Impact:**\n\nUnique among SIP-031 grants: this proposal does not require STX price appreciation to succeed. Funds burn immediately to permanent liquidity. Foundation maintains zero ongoing obligation, zero custody risk, and zero dependency on market conditions for grant impact delivery.\n\n### Grant Risks & Mitigation\n\n**Reputational Considerations:**\n\nSolana Foundation backing BONK as explicit user acquisition tool established institutional precedent. We follow proven playbook, not experimental approach. DOGE ranks 8th crypto by market cap; memecoins demonstrate institutional legitimacy and proven user adoption capability across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana ecosystems. WELSH already drove Stacks' largest adoption surge (Q4 2023 - Q1 2024)‚Äîthis grant scales demonstrated success rather than speculating on unproven theory.\n\n**Foundation Safety:**\n\nTrustless burn mechanism eliminates traditional grant risks. Funds cannot be misappropriated, withdrawn, or controlled by any individual or team. STX issued from Treasury directly into ecosystem-wide aggregated liquidity pools, burned atomically. No single protocol or team controls funds. Safer than traditional grants where builders maintain custody and discretionary spending authority. Fully verifiable on-chain.\n\n**Execution Reliability:**\n\n5-year linear deployment ($550 STX/day) allows adaptive response to market conditions while maintaining consistent opportunity for user acquisition. Daily DCA front-running is proven mechanism (historical precedent: every announced DCA schedule creates speculation and trading activity).

          "body": "Hey hey, the proposed budget is well outside the realm of possibility for this interim grant program, but I'd encourage you to stay tuned for the larger Stacks Endowment grant program expected later this year. This program is derived from Stacks Foundation funds so it is inherently more limited. The good news is I think you have all the information you'd likely need to pursue that with them when those opportunities become available.\n\nIn full transparency, this proposal is also tricky on a few other levels just so you have the full context: \n- Fairness to other projects - I expect that we'd anger a lot of other communities/social/meme tokens or it would create expectations we do this for every token. Not a blocker on its own, but a consideration to how we should handle this issue as a community and who gets what and why. In my opinion, this should be something way more people get together and discuss before a single group sets a precedent.\n- Compliance for a US company like us touching social/memecoins - this remains an area our counsel generally doesn't want us touching. The risk and compliance realities for Endowment and Labs are different, being built specifically with this in mind, so this aligns with my suggestion to look for programs from them because they should be allowed to operate in this area cleanly.\n- This came in well after the deadline (in terms of when the substance was actually added to the issue) so we'd be asking the committee to make an exception in considering it.\n\nI'd be happy to jump on a call and chat through what some short-term options are outside the grant track as I think this path likely has too many blockers, but I'd like to keep you moving somehow.

          "body": "Thanks @xyzerobtc, pretty clear overall. A couple questions/ideas:\n\n- I think it is worth considering how we integrate/absorb the forum into your platform. I'd argue activity there should be weighted pretty heavily against regular social activity and you could do interesting things like show people a clear path to progress an idea/discussion from there to later stages of implementation, say into a grant or a SIP, etc. and show people the progression of work in the ecosystem by various parties.\n- In terms of social data/ranking, if you haven't connected with Joe from LunarCrush already, it's probably worth a chat on where there could be some shortcuts leveraging some of the awesome stuff they've built. I'm especially curious what the 'formula' is here for reputation and how it has been made sufficiently un-gamable. Back to the Klout days, this has been a very hard problem to solve and you have to be quite opinionated about what makes a 'good' reputation as well. It would be great to understand that a bit further as one of the major features here is ultimately providing a score.\n- For the NovaAI features, I'm inclined to believe this is a decent bet to make, but would love to know how much of sort of the 'basic personalization' we could get away with initially or if you think its just cheaper to jump straight to AI-based personalization. Even in the Wordpress days, we could do pretty good personalization and given the ecosystem isn't huge, I wonder if there's a sensible MVP of this feature or to hear that 'AI is the MVP' in this case. We don't really have *any* personalization today - a hub that's uniquely mine that also allows for some training would be great, for example I'd like to 'follow' specific grants or SIPs or discussions, etc. and be able to see those in my dashboard while deprioritizing things I'm less interested in.\n- Would you plan to offer jobs/gigs as part of these personalized offerings? I assume so since you have this module already, but I am curious how folks would be validated for certain recommended positions. In my experience, the real risk here is that employers don't immediately get hits on their listings via the platform and so they move away, or worse, they get unqualified recommendations and consider the candidates there spam. I'd like to hear the loose plan to ensure that doesn't happen - there are whole companies dedicated to job/gig boards and it's not simple to crack but would also be HUGE if you did. \n\nLast but not least, when we connect next, let's discuss how/where this overlaps with the ideas we've talked about and whether or not the grant is the best vehicle for funding this work or some more ongoing contract like we've discussed too. We're generally flexible in aligning these things to the best format for all and we'd like to be an active/ongoing partner in helping you develop and amplify the features we've talked about, particularly in light of narrowing our focus to Governance over time as Stacks Labs boots up :).

          "body": "Yeah agreed, it's something we talked about in our first call as well. I don't find that its currently *not* transparent, all that is recorded in the SIP, social, etc. it's more that on any given day its harder to see what the status is because these are often discussions happening among a group and they need to report back. Simply giving labels to what is already happening and having a place to refresh/check on where we are in the SIP lifecycle would be a good step forward. \n\nOne thing I think is really important to watch out for with real-time voting results though, is the impact of influence. For example, we often hold our vote to the very end as not to shade anyone's decision or create any sense of pressure. I think if you start to let votes be led by cults of personality (i.e. a group that will just blindly vote along one influencers opinion because they really like them) rather than individuals making their own decisions, that can be dicey. It's something to figure out in implementation and I think there are big questions to answer about people's right to vote privately that this surfaces, but I think it's solvable.\n\nMy suggestion would be to focus first on the high-level SIP status tracker and nail that experience before layering in this concept of a reputation score on everyone's vote.",

          "body": "Hey team, appreciate that application! I think that for the committee to be able to move this forward, we'll need to scope the budget much tighter against the milestones. Here are some questions I hope can guide you:\n\n- How do you see the funding unlocks relative to the milestones? Specifically, how can we shuffle things such that we get something into the market with fewer expenses and overhead so we can drive back some more data that its working/successful? We want to see some clear demand that we can then double down on before committing to the full grant amount. Please help us understand how we can 'lean' this out to get something out there and then funding from various sources could open up.\n- What's the truest MVP here? Similar to the first bullet, could you take a stab at flipping the milestones such that get to market as quickly as possible against the smallest budget possible (ala a true MVP) and then for subsequent milestones list the success criteria where you think it would be fair to open up further funding. Ala \"ok we spent 10k to get it live and we have X many users, at that point we deserve further funding for ___\", and so on. This should help offset what we agree is the major risk, a possible lack of adoption. If you can create some specific goalposts you're aiming for that when reached, unlock more of the grant, we can get more comfortable with it overall. \n- Generally, grants are not intended to cover people's salaries, we want to see what's getting built against what costs and to unlock funding tranches as things are working and becoming successful. Please consider this as you rework your milestones/overall request. \n- Is any of what you are building going to be made available to other devs or open-sourced?\n",

          "body": "Thanks @Hero-Gamer off the bat I'm curious why this wouldn't be a better fit for DeGrants üòâ? Next, it is a little unclear to me at each milestone the number of people onboarded/impacted etc. Is that limited to the '3 AI mentees' educated? For milestone 1, this is put against a budget of over $8,000 dollars which is high relative to any developer CAC I have seen in and around our space. Could you speak more to why or why these mentees are inherently more valuable/expensive? \n\nIn general if you could make a clear line item for the total people attending events, getting exposure, receiving content, etc. via this overall effort, I think that would strengthen the proposal considerably. Right now, one interpretation is that essentially the $21k gets us 12 trained devs - my assumption is actually that a lot more impact is expected in greater numbers from the events and workshops, but those are not included so we're looking for projections there. All of the 'stuff happening' is great as a rough indicator of what this will look like, but I want to see it oriented around impact and traction more than the events/deliverables. I gave similar feedback on another grant, I want to get in the habit of our ecosystem measuring traction and impact over the actions themselves. We do events to onboard people, so let's measure people onboarded directly. If you can rework the milestones with this in mind that would be awesome, thanks so much! üôè",

With this budget, we will implement *a points-based contribution system* where developers, designers, marketers and founders automatically earn tokens when milestones are achieved and apps reach the market. Over time, this creates a repeatable engine for producing Stacks apps while giving builders direct ownership in the ecosystems they help grow.\n- **Grant Impact:**‚Ää‚Ää‚ÄäWith this grant, we will deliver a Stacks-native contribution and reward system that makes it seamless for anyone to earn tokens by building or marketing Vibes DAO launched apps. Immediately, 20% of the grant budget will be allocated to the Vibes DAO Treasury, acting as a mini‚Äìdegrants program governed by VIBES token holders to fund and incentivize additional builders. Long term, the reward framework created through this grant can be adopted by other Stacks DAOs and teams, compounding ecosystem growth: more apps shipped, more contributors retained, and more value recycled back into Stacks through treasury expansion. Success will be measured in: #of contributors rewarded via the points system #of apps shipped to mainnet.\n- **Grant Risks:** The primary risks are:\na) Low contributor participation - If builders do not engage, the pipeline of apps may stall.\nMitigation: Leverage our 6,000+ talent database and existing Jobs app to ensure contributor flow.\nb) Complexity of fair rewards distribution - Misaligned incentives could lead to disputes over contributions.\nMitigation: Implement a transparent points-to-tokens system, with oversight from Vibes Dao Treasury Council and on-chain records of contributions.\nc) Scope creep across too many apps - Risk of dilution if DAO tries to build everything at once.\nMitigation: Focus grant funds on launching 3-5 high quality flagship apps, proving the model before expanding.\n- **Traction:** HireVibes already manages the largest talent network in the ecosystem (6,000+ developers, designers, etc.), giving us a strong base of contributors ready to engage. Many of these builders are actively looking for opportunities to add real projects to enhance their resumes, learn new tools, and work in a community-driven environment. We‚Äôve already shipped key components that demonstrate execution:\n\n- DAO Infrastructure: The [Vibes DAO MVP](https://app.hirevibes.com/dao-community) is already live with open-source code available at [GitHub](https://github.com/hirevibes/vibes-dao)\n- Marketing & Onboarding: We launched a dedicated landing page at [vibesdao.fun](https://vibesdao.fun/) to attract contributors and showcase the vision.\n- Proven Impact Track Record: Our team previously built a transparent donation system at [HireVibes](https://www.hirevibes.com/donations) that funded 20+ clean-water wells in Africa‚Äîproviding safe drinking water to 4,000+ people to this day.\n\nIn addition, ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù is gaining traction as a fun and effective way for builders to upskill, get real experience while potentially earning rewards. With already owning the $VIBES token ticker, we are positioned to establish ourselves as _the_ _Vibe Coding DAO of crypto._\n\nCurrent indicators of traction:\n\n- Active users: ~200 monthly active users on the HireVibes platform applying and referring to open jobs.\n- Transaction volume: ~$80,000+ distributed to the Vibes DAO treasury & regenerative finance projects through jobs filled on the platform.\n- Treasury: ~$1,000 currently sitting in the Vibes DAO treasury, earmarked for contributor rewards.\n- Pipeline: ~10 developers already on a waitlist to start building through Vibes DAO once fully launched.\n\nThis grant will allow us to scale from manual, experimental DAO payouts into a fully automated contribution system, unlocking the potential of thousands of builders and a steady pipeline of Bitcoin apps on Stacks.\n\n## üõ£Ô∏è Grant Roadmap & Deliverables\n- **Deliverable:** A Stacks-native contribution and reward system integrated into the Vibes DAO platform. This system will include;\n\n- An interface where contributors can browse open tasks/bounties for Vibes DAO apps.\n- A points-to-token reward engine that automatically tracks contributions and issues VIBES and STX tokens once milestones are verified.\n- Launch of at least one flagship Bitcoin app to demonstrate the system in action and showcase shipped projects on contributors‚Äô resumes.\n\n- **Milestones:** \n\nMilestone 1 ‚Äì DAO Treasury Expansion & Setup (Month 1)\n\n- Allocate 20% of grant funds to the DAO Treasury (mini‚Äìdegrants model).\n- Explain the transparent multisig system for payouts.\n- Deliverable: Publicly documented DAO treasury with governance rules including a 7 day voting window.\n\nMilestone 2 ‚Äì Contribution Points System (Months 1‚Äì2)\n\n- Build contribution tracking system (task creation, points assignment, proof of work submission).\n- Integrate with VIBES & STX token reward logic (manual payouts initially).\n- Pilot rewards for first 20 contributors.\n- Deliverable: Live contribution system MVP + first contributors rewarded.\n\nMilestone 3 ‚Äì Web Interface & Automation (Months 3)\n\n- Launch a user-facing web portal where contributors can track points, and claim rewards.\n- Automate points-to-token distribution.\n- Onboard community into first 1-2 flagship app builds.\n- Deliverable: Public web interface + automated reward payouts live.\n\nMilestone 4 ‚Äì App Launch & Flywheel Activation (Months 3‚Äì4)\n\n- Ship MVPs of 1-2 flagship Bitcoin apps through the Vibes DAO process.\n- Showcase shipped projects to spread the vibe and attract more builders.\n- Fund additional contributor proposals via treasury to continue flywheel.\n- Deliverable: 1 live Bitcoin app + proof of DAO-funded, community-built development cycle.\n",

Success will be measured by the number of proposals created, votes cast, and at least one completed real-world action (e.g., sale, loan, or donation of an artwork) resulting directly from the on-chain governance process.\n\n- **Grant Risks:**  \n  - *Risk: Low engagement by collectors.*  \n    *Mitigation:* Begin with known, engaged collectors from existing collections, and use outreach to onboard them into voting.  We already did a crude test earlier this year using currently available tools in the ecosystem using ballot.gg: https://x.com/anibalbosco/status/1880737928093344169\n  - *Risk: Technical complexity of wallet integration or voting logic.*  \n    *Mitigation:* Start with minimal viable architecture, use existing Stacks tools/libraries, and expand iteratively.  \n  - *Risk: Real-world logistics (e.g., shipping, disputes).*  \n    *Mitigation:* Limit scope to decision-making app; physical logistics handled by Curator Collective as a service.\n\n- **Traction:**  \n  - *Active users:* Curator Collective has already onboarded ‚Ää[artists](https://www.curatorbtc.com/artists) and collectors across several [collections](https://www.curatorbtc.com/collections). A great example of a collection engaging users is [NFTs for Peace](https://stacks.gamma.io/collections/nfts-for-peace): this was THE first generative music collection on Stacks, in which the NFTs backing the physical art were music with visuals co-created with Sean Longstreet](https://x.com/longstreetBTC), Manuel Gimferrer (who did the original composition), Adrian Lewandowski (coding), and number of musicians that recorded some of the stems used for generation. This also had contributions from several community members that prepared their own versions mixing stems. One of my favorite ones is [this one](https://stacks.gamma.io/collections/nfts-for-peace/330) by [jim.btc](https://x.com/jimdotbtc), the creator of Audionals.\n\n  - *Transaction volume:* Prior NFT collections minted and distributed. For example, the collection [Future of Money](https://stacks.gamma.io/collections/future-of-money) was THE first collection ever to mint using a SIP-10 token for payment and it sold out in 10 minutes. In addition to the primary mint volume, the secondary market volume of Curator Collective collections is 15400 STX.\n  - *TVL:* Not applicable.  \n  - *Waitlist:* Not applicable. During phase 2, outside the scope of this grant, we will build of platform for crowdsourcing the purchases of new physical pieces; a variation of the current model in which the Curator Collective buys the paintings beforehand.\n\n---\n\n## üõ£Ô∏è Grant Roadmap & Deliverables\n- **Deliverable:**  \n  A working web application where NFT holders connect their wallets, create proposals about artworks, and vote on them. Outcomes are recorded on-chain, and Curator Collective carries out real-world actions in accordance with results.\n\n- **Milestones:**  \n  Since the request is below $10k, milestones are simple:  \n  1. **Month 1‚Äì2:** Design and develop wallet integration + proposal creation system.  \n  2. **Month 2‚Äì3:** Implement on-chain voting logic and UI for viewing proposals and results.  \n  3. **Month 4:** Run pilot vote with an existing Curator Collective artwork; document, summarize, and share results.\n",

          "body": "The grant states that your Grant Goal is to _\"Build and deploy a wallet-integrated web app that enables NFT holders to propose and vote on actions for physical artworks in Curator Collective‚Äôs existing collections.\"_ \n\nApologies if I have misunderstood the phrasing, 'build and deploy' reads very much like a new undertaking for me, even in the context of the existing community/following. In addition, I looked around previously when I came across CuratorBTC and then again when this grant came in for an existing wallet/web app and could not find one (I only see the main website). That's where my framing that this is brand new work comes from. Let me know if I am missing something that already exists, would love to try it out! \n\nIn terms of DeGrants, there are different categories allocated for different types of work, so you are not competing with artists and the overall budget there is flexible. If they receive a ton of high-quality applications, the figure awarded can rise to match. I still recommend this as a great path for you - it is particularly well-aligned to the interests of many stewards, putting them in the best position to support you in a hands-on manner as you continue looking to grow this with the addition of the wallet/app/gov features. \n\nIf you still don't want to pursue DeGrants, I think this is potentially still workable if you can be more specific about your current traction numbers and then expected growth. The committee primarily wants to see a clear path to measurable growth and impact.",

          "body": "Thanks for the submission @block9app! A number of things off the top here for you to consider:\n\n- There's very little listed under traction that is measured in user growth, TVL, etc. Finished work is great, but we're trying to avoid 'build it and they will come' scenarios. Could you please speak to what traction you currently have?\n- Similarly, could you talk us through why this and why now? Do you have clear indications of demand for a product like this? Waitlist? etc.? What makes you confident there are people in need of this and willing to pay for it (at some point).\n- Most importantly, I'd like to see this proposal focus on one thing, right now you are proposing what I perceive to be two (maybe 3) very different things. One is an app for secure document exchange, another is a service business or agency. Related, I personally find the notion of postcards written to business owners confusing - is this a feature you expect to launch in the app? Is there clear indication of demand for this? Is it served inside the document sharing application? Is that just part of the marketing plan?\n \nGenerally, I think the proposal takes far too long to get to market and shipping marketing before the app is actually ready to be used by users is most often a waste of those resources. Flipping this around such that you get an MVP out asap and in the hands of users would be something the committee will insist on, from there further marketing can drive growth. In this proposal we aren't getting to market until February at a cost of $44k. I would challenge you to throw everything that's absolutely not necessary to be in scope out, and pare this down into one 10k milestone that gets something live and in the hands of users within a month or so. From there we can readily see if this has legs. If you'd like more hands on help with this process, Stacks Ascent (https://stacks.org/ascent) or DeGrants (https://degrants.xyz) may be a better starting place as stewards and ecosystem contributors can get hands on with you to help you do this :).

This will serve as a home base to separate real, deployed projects from purely marketed ones (e.g., highlighting that projects like Stacks have many live apps, while others, like Arch, have had prolonged pre-live marketing). I already own the domain bitcoinmarketmap.com.\n- **Grant Impact:**‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää‚Ää This website can help users discern between what is marketing and what is real quickly by going to the BitcoinMarketMap. Stacks is one of the leaders in deployed applications in the Bitcoin eco, which can be seen more clearly with BitcoinMarketMap.\n- **Grant Risks:** I'll be vibe coding this on weekends. So potential technical limitations might arise. But this risk is low as the website is not technically difficult, and I know technically minded people who'd be willing to help at roadblocks.\n- **Traction:** No traction. Done some initial design mockups and vibe coding.\n\n## üõ£Ô∏è Grant Roadmap & Deliverables\n- **Deliverable:**‚Ää BitcoinMarketMap.com website with a database of Bitcoin projects, broken down by ecosystem. (Bitcoin L1, Lightning, Off-chain, Sidechains, Metaprotocols)\nEach entry will include: ecosystem, name, description, logo, and a link to the main product. \nA Stacks banner will be placed on the homepage for the first six months.\n- **Milestones:** Only one: Expected to be finished within one month. A portion of the grant funds will then be used as an incentive for users from other ecosystems to crowdsource live dapps via a Google Form.\n\nThanks for reviewing. \nHit me with your questions.\nJake.\n",

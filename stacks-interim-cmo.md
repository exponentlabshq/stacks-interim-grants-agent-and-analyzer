# It's official: we're hiring a CMO for Stacks Labs

But of course this isn't just a CMO for a company, you'll be the CMO for the entire @Stacks project - helping scale up Stacks and Bitcoin for the next generation of users.

Stacks is one of the oldest and largest Bitcoin projects out there - we literally coined the phrase "Bitcoin layers" - but we need to get way bigger to fulfill our vision of making Bitcoin programmable and scaling it. 

You'll do all the standard stuff to lead a marketing team, but more importantly you'll work directly with me and the rest of the team to craft the Stacks narrative define us in the market, and bring in the builders and users to do so.

Most importantly we don't expect you to have been a CMO before - we want someone who is looking for their chance to grow and make their mark.

## Chief Marketing Officer

As Chief Marketing Officer for Stacks Labs, you will craft and execute a global marketing strategy that deepens developer engagement and positions Stacks as the leading Bitcoin Layer 2. You'll own the entire brand and narrative for the Stacks project as well as the strategy for bringing in new users and spreading the gospel of Stacks & Bitcoin.

Nakamoto and sBTC set the technical foundation for fast blocks, Bitcoin finality, and a trust‑minimized BTC asset on Stacks. Now we need to translate that capability into a compelling narrative with more builders, more users, more liquidity, and greater on‑chain activity.

You'll be a key member of the Stacks Labs executive team, reporting directly to the CEO, and lead a high-performing marketing organization. You'll partner closely with Engineering, Product, Dev Rel, Business Development, and ecosystem partners to grow Stacks and help onboarding the next wave of users to Bitcoin.

This is a rare opportunity to join early and define the voice, presence, and playbook of a new crypto-native entity that sits at the intersection of Bitcoin and Web3 innovation.

### Outcomes You'll Drive

- A unified brand and growth strategy that scales Stacks into both consumer and enterprise mindshare.
- Broader ecosystem growth: stronger developer adoption, retail user activation, and institutional engagement.
- Increased visibility and influence: greater share of voice across crypto and financial markets.
- Measurable impact from campaigns and launches: clear objectives, consistent reporting, and continuous improvement.

### What We're Looking For

- **A Knack for Narrative & Brand Building** - we’re defining a whole new space, so we particularly need someone with a strength in narrative & brand design, competitive positioning, and product marketing for complex roadmaps.
- **Deep experience at a personal level with crypto and its culture** - at a minimum you own  hardware wallets, have messed around with everything from DeFi to NFTs to memecoins, and might have even lost some money. You should also have a strong understanding of the crypto/Web3 space, especially developer ecosystems, and DeFi platforms.
- **A background in startups and early stage companies** - there’s something a bit different about operating at the early stages - handling both high level vision/strategy but also being able to roll up your sleeves and handle things yourself.
- **Experience as a marketing leader** - You’ll be responsible for our high level strategy and leading a team, so you should have 10+ years of experience in marketing and leadership roles, with at least some of that in crypto or financial services.
- **Institutional + retail range** – you can credibly engage institutional and corporate decision-makers while also inspiring grassroots crypto communities.
- **Passion** - This isn’t an area where things come easily, so our CMO needs to have a passion for Bitcoin, open-source ecosystems, and pushing the edges of crypto adoption.

### What We’d Also Like To See

- **Strong familiarity with Bitcoin and the ecosystem landscape** - including leading crypto projects, the Stacks ecosystem, and general Bitcoin narratives
- **A fluency in both DeFi and TradFi, their systems, and users** - you’ll be helping explain to people how we bridge the gap between these areas
- **Public speaking experience** - ideally you’ll be one of our key faces talking about Stacks & Bitcoin, with a presence on stage, on podcasts, at community events, and via traditional media

### What You Don’t Need

- **Prior CMO Title** - while we need someone with management and leadership experience, you don’t need to have done exactly this job before - we care more about your impact than your title history.

### What We Offer

- A competitive base salary, plus STX based token incentives, and a wide range of benefits
- The opportunity to make your mark and bring the promise of Bitcoin to a whole lot of people
- One of the most enjoyable teams in crypto to work with - and some experienced marketers who know Stacks well
